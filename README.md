# Fullstack Development Scholarship by Visiola Foundation
This repository contains all the materials I have created and used during my 2 months of learning in the full-stack development course.

## Course Overview
The Fullstack Development course covers a wide range of topics, including front-end development, back-end development, and databases. Here are some of the skills and tools I have learned during the course:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building dynamic web pages and web applications
React for building complex front-end applications
Node.js for building scalable and robust back-end applications
Relational database for storing and managing data
Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development
Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

front-end: This directory contains all the code and files related to front-end development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as any third-party libraries or frameworks I have used.
back-end: This directory contains all the code and files related to back-end development, such as Node.js files, as well as any database schema or migration files.
database: This directory contains all the code and files related to the database, such as data models, database queries, or backup files.
